        I'm Vincent Qi, a CS student at Carnegie Mellon University,
        <br /> and Ex-Founding SWE at EduBeyond.
        <br />
        <br />
        At 16, I started EduBeyond, an EdTech startup that built LLM powered
        Learning Management Systems and earned UN recognition. I developed a
        fullstack web app using next, and researched a novel education-oriented
        RAG pipeline with Python, PGVector, and the OpenAI SDK.
        <br />
        <br />
        My current software and research interests include educational AI
        systems, scalable vector databases, vectorization methods, and retrieval
        models.
        <br />
        <br />
        As always, I enjoy drawing, skiing, solving puzzles, and experimenting
        with computer graphics.
        <br />
        <br />
        Welcome to my page, enjoy your stay, and feel free to reach out!
